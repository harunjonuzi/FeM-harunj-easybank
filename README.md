### What I learned

I learned alot about Sass and Grid.

### Continued development

In the future I want to be able to fix an issue which is caused when in mobile view, opening the menu and then resizing to Desktop view, there is a weird bug happening there but as soon as I learn more about JavaScript I will be able to fix it.
